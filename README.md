 Graph from table to matrix and combinatorics

 matrixfromtable.R -> Code to get an matrix from a table. For example, given a network of interactions structured in a table as present here, it is possible to get a interactions matrix that can be used for computational implementation of a mathematical model with an arbitrary number of variables.

 graphcombinatorics.R -> Code to get the combinations of a matrix with some unknown interactions. [Outdated]
